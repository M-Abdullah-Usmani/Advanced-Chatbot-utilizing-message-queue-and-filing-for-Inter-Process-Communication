# Advanced-Chatbot-utilizing-message-queue-and-filing-for-Inter-Process-Communication

TITLE: The project is titled as Execution Number Cruncher.  

INTRODUCTION: Execution Number Cruncher, like its name hints, will figure and calculate the exhibition/performance of certain IPC (Inter Process Communications)  approaches dependent on a proper algorithm. The program will let the customer/client realize which approach is superior to the next by positioning them from best to  most exceedingly terrible. The program will likewise show the time taken by the chosen issues/problems to execute utilizing each upheld IPC approach.   

Approaches: This program will support the following IPC approaches:  
1) Filing  
2) Message Queue   

Project Description: In this project, we came up with 2 methods of inter-process communication; message passing and filing, and we applied three methods to each  of mentioned approaches.   

Problems: 
Chatbot  

Chatbot: In this problem, message could be send and receive on either terminals. Problem will also notify if other person is typing a message.   

Comparison:  
Filing= 0.000076  
Message Queue= 0.00072   

The result shows that when this problem was done using filing it took 0.000076 while using message queue time taken was 0.00072 , which shows filing approach was faster 

*Important: This is linux based project. Might throw errors on Windows and MAC OS.
